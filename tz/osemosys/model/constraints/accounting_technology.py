def add_accounting_technology_constraints(ds: xr.Dataset, m: Model) -> Model:
    """Add accounting_technology constraints to the model.
    Creates intermediate results variables that are not strictly needed for the optimisation but
    are useful when analysing results. E.g. 'ProductionByTechnology' and 'UseByTechnology'.

    Arguments
    ---------
    ds: xarray.Dataset
        The parameters dataset
    m: linopy.Model
        A linopy model

    Returns
    -------
